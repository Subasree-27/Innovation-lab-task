            <p>
                I am here to do just that. COFFEE IS LIFE. Coffee is a metaphor for life that has transformed how I go about my decisions. Quality of coffee has soared higher than expected within the past 10 years. Coffee connoisseurs today fine tune coffee to the last particle, accounting for roast profile, extraction rate, grind size, water temperature, along with the other hundred factors. Other’s say it’s JUST coffee, give me some coffee with some cream and sugar, it’s a simple commodity. The question is not who is right, but what can I learn from both those perspectives. Quality is what gives us purpose. Quality of food, relationships, exercise, experiences and YES something as simple as coffee.

                The culture around coffee is not what has given me such inspiration to pursue it as a career, but rather my personal relationship to the seed (coffee is the seed of a fruit). Caring about something so simple in my life, a detail between all the clutter that surrounds my ever-changing, complex existence. My realization is, YES IT IS JUST COFFEE and the details of our life are what compile the whole.
